# Snake on Surfaces

## Overview

An AR/XR take on the arcade classic Snake. This project uses TypeScript and Three.js
with Vite for quick WebGL previews.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies with `npm install`.
Run `npm run dev` to start the development server and open `localhost:5173` in your browser.
Execute `npm test` to run the Vitest suite.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys or WASD to steer the snake. Press the spacebar to pause or resume.
Eat the red fruit to grow longer. Colliding with your own body ends the game.

## Development

All code lives under `src/`. Unit tests reside in `tests/`.
